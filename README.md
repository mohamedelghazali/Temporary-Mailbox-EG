# Temporary-Mailbox-EG
T-M-EG Provides a disposable, temporary mailbox for receiving emails. Generate random or custom email address with available domains, and receive email messages.

Uses temp-mail.org's API [https://temp-mail.org/en/api](https://temp-mail.org/en/api).


### Install ###

Just include ```dist/Temporary-Mailbox-EG.php``` file and you're ready to go.




### NOTES ###

* temp-mail's API doesn't handle too much requests very well. So don't push it with more than 1 request every few seconds.
* All incoming emails are removed within approximately 10 minutes after admission.
